I am a curious guy. Always serching happiness, a little difficult, isn't it? But when you finally find it... Oh my God... all the waiting was totally worth it.
So now here I am, thinking about a girl with a big smile. Right now I don't care about programming too much, I want to look for that girl... I hope that in the final version I will have found her!
